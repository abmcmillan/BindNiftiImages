This script is a tool to bind multiple Nifti or DICOM images into a single image by resampling each image to a common image space, as might be necessary for multi-region or whole-body imaging. Overlapping regions are averaged together.

Inputs:
    --input: The input images/directories to combine.
    --output: The output image.
    --as_float: Convert the images to float before combining.
    --interp_type: Interpolation type to use. Default is linear.
    --voxel_size: The voxel size of the output image (three floating point inputs). Default is to infer from the first input.

Outputs:
    The output image.

Example usage:
    python BindImages.py --input image1.nii.gz image2.nii.gz --output bound_image.nii.gz
    python BindImages.py --input dicom_dir1 dicom_dir2 --output bound_image.nii.gz

Notes:
    The current implementation is simple and may not handle oblique images well. Additionally, better strategies for
    merging overlapping regions should be investigated.

Requirements:
    - SimpleITK
    - numpy
    - Python 3.6 or higher
